# Proposed Ideas

Initially we thought of working on the **Food Pantry** Application for our university. Currently many students aren't aware of the pantry which has supplies like ready to go food stuff, some bath supplies and snacks.
We thought that we could do an application which students could use to take a look at the application and get to know if the items they need are in the pantry or not and then decide to stop by and pickup stuff needed.

Some of the features which we thought we could implement were adding image search and then tracking the search information and trying to predict the items which students are searching for the most.
