# Proposed Ideas

Initially we thought of working on the **Food Pantry** Application for our university. Currently many students aren't aware of the pantry which has supplies like ready to go food stuff, some bath supplies and snacks.
We thought that we could do an application which students could use to take a look at the application and get to know if the items they need are in the pantry or not and then decide to stop by and pickup stuff needed.

Some of the features which we thought we could implement were adding image search and then tracking the search information and trying to predict the items which students are searching for the most.

While discussing about the events in the college and make an application to make all events visible at one place with the necessary description, I have suggested to make this available for only ISA students. But after the effective suggestions and team discussions we have decided to make this available for all the students and organizations in the university. 

Our goal in this project is to display all events happening in all the branches which includes date, time, location, description of the event, seats available and
cost for registration. Using this application we are making it easy for the people to know when and where event is taking place and if interested they can make payment
and book a slot for them.
