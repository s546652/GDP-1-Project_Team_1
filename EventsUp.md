# GDP-1-Project_Team_1

For our Graduate Directed Project we decided to work on an application which is going to show up all the events that are going to take place in the university.
After some internal discussions we thought of developing the applicaition using ***IOS***. 

Our team's first go to step is to get the *permissions related to university calendar* so that we can aviod the manual event entry into the database to aviod any mistakes. We are then going to decide on the milestones and how to distriubute the work among the team for the sprints.
