# GDP-1-Project_Team_1 -- EventsUp

For our Graduate Directed Project we decided to work on an application which is going to show up all the events that are going to take place in the university.
After some internal discussions we thought of developing the applicaition using ***IOS***. 

Our team's first go to step is to get the *permissions related to university calendar* so that we can aviod the manual event entry into the database to aviod any mistakes. If we didn't get the permission we try to use web scraper to fetch the elements from the University calender event page and convert it into app suiting way.

We are then going to decide on the milestones and how to distriubute the work among the team for the sprints.

As a team we have thought about certain ideas like using a QRcode scanning for the e-pass and then we are yet to decide on how to implement the payment gateway. We are thinking to gather the requirements to set up the user stories and work accordingly.

As a team, we discussed that the home page contains 3 module login, one for the student who has their SID, the other for general people who donâ€™t have SID can log in as a guest, and the 3rd module is used by the administration to update the event in the calendar manually. 

While discussing about the name for our project we did choose many names like Event Check, Make An Event, Events Up. But keeping in mind that short name could make students to remember easily. So we collectively agreed on "EventsUp" as our app name.

As part of our application we also want to include a feature to make users available to buy their tickets online. For that we need to implement apple pay to make the transaction possible. So started learning more about that.
