# GDP-1-Project_Team_1

For our Graduate Directed Project we decided to work on an application which is going to show up all the events that are going to take place in the university.
After some internal discussions we thought of developing the applicaition using ***IOS***. 

Our team's first go to step is to get the *permissions related to university calendar* so that we can aviod the manual event entry into the database to aviod any mistakes. We are then going to decide on the milestones and how to distriubute the work among the team for the sprints.

As a team we have thought about certain ideas like using a QRcode scaning for the e-pass and then we are yet to decide on how to implement the payment gateway. We are thinking to gather the requirements to set up the user stories and work accordingly.

As a team, we discussed that the home page contains 3 module login, one for the student who has their SID, the other for general people who donâ€™t have SID can log in as a guest, and the 3rd module is used by the administration to update the event in the calendar manually.
